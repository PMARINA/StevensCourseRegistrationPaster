<h1>Compatibility</h1>
This script will only work if you have 10 classes or less. If you have more than 10, this can be used to automate each set, but will need to be modified. This script should be run from Python IDLE. It has been tested with python 3 on a PC running Windows 10.
<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>
<ol>
  <li> Open CMD
  <li> pip install pyperclip
</ol>
<h1>How to use</h1>
<ol>
  <li> Open the script in IDLE
  <li> Change the values in line 5 to your own classes. ENSURE THAT YOU ARE TYPING IN THE CORRECT VALUES... If you have fewer than 10 classes, just remove the strings you don't need at the end of the list. 
  <li> Open the registration page in a modern browser
  <li> When the page loads, switch to the script. It must be the first thing to be opened using alt-tab. If you mess up, alt-tab back to the page, then alt-tab to the script. 
  <li> Run the script. It will alt tab to the page for you.
  <li> You have 2 seconds to click on the first box to add a class. Do not mess up. If you think you'll need more time, change the 2 in line 21 to a higher number. If you're feeling risky, go for a smaller value. Do not remove the sleep statements. The script will break. 
  <li> The boxes should now be filled in for you.
  <li> Hit submit
  <li> Happy Scheduling!
</ol>
<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
I claim no responsibility for the script breaking, registering for classes you didn't mean to, causing you delays in registration, causing your computer to break (keys will seem to stick if the script is interrupted... hit ctrl-alt-delete, then escape, or restart), etc. Use at your own risk.
